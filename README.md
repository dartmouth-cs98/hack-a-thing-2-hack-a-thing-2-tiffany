# hack-a-thing-2-tiffany

### Description of what you attempted to build:

- I attempted to build a mobile app with a welcome screen that lead to a notes/announcement page. Users can add and delete notes that they've created.

### What you learned

- How to setup react native, expo, and ios and andriod simulators
- Debugging on react native using logs, chrome developer tools, vscode
- Make sure to stop debugging session before continue coding
- How to publish apps with Expo
- How to navigate between screens
- Props and states
- React-Native APIs
- React-Native components:
  - SafeAreaView
  - Buttons
  - StyleSheet
  - Images
  - Alerts
  - Platform
  - Hooks
  - Flex
  - Navigator

### How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your possible project ideas?

- This hack-a-thing relates to our project idea because they're both mobile applications and centered around the creation of lists. For our project, we want to create an announcement board and grocery list. This hack-a-thing allowed to familiarize myself with React-Native as well as create a super basic MVP for a personal announcment app. This basic structure will be expanded upon greatly in our project.

### What didnâ€™t work

- react native gesture handler, kept running into the error with "unable to resolve module 'react-native-gesture-handler'", discussed it was a dependency issue and had to redownload
- Struggled a lot at the beginning figuring out navigation between screens, the above issues also contributed
- I followed a tutorial that was a little outdated, so I had to find workarounds and look for the new syntax for things

### Opinions:

- Expo makes it so much more convenient to deploy and test mobile apps
- My previous hack-a-thing on CSS and HTML was still pretty helpful in creating the components
- Props and states are still a bit confusing to me.
- Super amazed by React-Native's ability to code across android and ios, I learned a little bit of Swift in the past and I wish I had learned about React-Native.
